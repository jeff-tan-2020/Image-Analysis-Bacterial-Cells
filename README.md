# Image-Analysis-Bacterial-Cells
Python GUI implemented in Jupyter Notebooks in Anaconda

## This GUI was created in a project to measure the length and width of bacterial cells to study their growth over time. 

- Running this GUI allows the user to use their mouse to select a region of interest from a '.tif' image
- A threshold value is applied to the region of interest to reduce noise
- OpenCV is implemented to apply a gaussian blur and the ellipse fitting method is used to measure the length and width of a circular object in this region
